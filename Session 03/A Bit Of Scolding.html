            Hi again it's soheil! <br>
            So this session didn't start very well because some of us didn't do our homework as we should have, 
            so our teacher scolded all of us for a short time, he also mentioned if we kept this up we were not going to progress at all, 
            we just lag behind and it gets worse as time goes on. <br>
            But enough of that in this session we learned a bit more than the last session, before that I forgot to upload a diary on our 2nd session so I gave a short one here. <br>
            In the 2nd session, we learned about how to use heading tags like h1, h2..., and h6 as the number gets closer to 6 the size of the header text gets smaller. <br>
            Also, we gained an understanding of how listing tags work in both [Order List] and [Unorder List] which we use ol and ul as tags and to list the items inside we simply use List [li] to include the items. <br>
            After being scolded in Session03 we started working on tables, 
            we understood that by just using table tag [table] nothing would happen and we had to define each row and each column by using [tr], and [td] respectively. <br>
            Apart from tables, we grasped how to use colors, we can use them in 3 ways, the first and easiest one is just by using solid colors, 
            the second way is to use RGB numbers and the last method is by using HEX numbers which is much harder than the other 2 combined. <br>
            We learned how to use links as well which was interesting to me because I always wanted to know how they work and it was simple.
