    <title>Session 06: Forgotten</title>

        <p>
            It's me again! <br>
            So as you can see I forgot to upload my diary on session 05, I'm going to write about sessions 04, 05, and 06 altogether here. <br>
            Let's start with session 04, it was an important session for me, we learned about [form] Tags and their child Tags [label],[input], <br>
            Without these, nothing will show on [form] itself and there are some [attributes] and [values] that are necessary for the [form] to work correctly, 
            an instance [form] ]label for="Names"]Name:[/label] [input type="text" name="Names"] [/form] This will show you a field where you can enter your name. <br>
            There are different types of input that you can use like [radio] and [checkbox] to select only 1 option or multiple options respectively. <br>
            On the 5th session, there we finished HTML4 and HTML5, and since HTML5 is just an upgrade nothing changed much from HTML4, 
            there were just a few Tags that that were new,
            the most important part was we learned how to put audio and video on the website.
            Last but not least on session 06 we started working on CSS, which is only for styling and designing your website, 
            but it has a lot of [Tags], [Attributes], [values], and the most important ones are [selectors] which select which part of your code you want to style, 
            there are a couple of ways to code but the most efficient one one creating a CSS file and linking it to your HTML file that way you keep your codes separate.
