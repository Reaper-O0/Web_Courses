            Hello there! <br>
            My name is Soheil Alizaee, and I'm currently in my fifth session of learning HTML. However, since a few new students joined our class, our teacher, Morteza Ghoddousi, decided to start from the very beginning. <br>
            He introduced himself and told us about his 8-year experience as a programmer. Then, he explained to us what we can expect to learn from this 60-session course. <br>
            Our goal is to learn HTML first, followed by CSS, PHP, and hopefully, JavaScript if we have enough time. <br>
            Our teacher began the class by teaching us about HTML basics. We learned that HTML is the foundation of every web page and that HTML code is used to display elements such as images, text, and tables. Then, we moved on to learn about Tags. <br>
            HTML is based on Tags, and there are two types of them: Container Tags and Empty Tags.HTML is based on Tags and there are 2 types of them: Container Tags and the other is Empty Tags
            <!-- There are 3 Tags that are used always <html></html>, <head></head>, <body></body>. -->
